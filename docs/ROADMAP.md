# Circle OS roadmap

Updated: 2026-11-11, Asia/Bangkok. This owns delivery dependencies and release
gates. [Product](PRODUCT.md) owns behavior; [Work plan](WORK_PLAN.md) owns the
ordered queue. No plan grants implementation or deployment approval.

## Delivery direction

Ship a mobile-first web beta for 10–20 friends/family testers, mainly in Myanmar
and Thailand, with accounts, safe sync, redesigned onboarding, manual membership
and requested paid Athena. iOS/Android follows learning from the web beta.

The replacement onboarding is [ONBOARDING_SPEC.md](ONBOARDING_SPEC.md).
The optional-action Day One plan is superseded as the future target. Current
Day One versions and old runs remain intact pending reviewed replacement.
Public signup is a target; public rollout and beta release are separate choices.

The earlier sequence requiring all stabilization and broad optimization before
accounts/Athena is retired. Critical safety and blocked launch journeys still
gate dependent work. Each approved slice follows the
[development cycle](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md); optimize only a measured problem.
Already approved visual slices are not undone by the broad-optimization deferral.

## Admin-first priority

The developer prioritizes [Content Admin and the shared catalog](CONTENT_ADMIN_PLAN.md)
first: account-bound access, Supabase content/media, then editors for chapters,
articles/blogs with images, habits and Protocols; Explore consumption follows.
This supersedes the earlier after-beta publishing deferral. Critical safety and
blocked journeys still gate dependent changes; other release requirements remain.
Implementation, remote setup and publication need reviewed scopes.

## Current delivery state

| Workstream | State and practical limit |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts/local isolation | Implemented; hosted entry/reset/logout/offline return have recorded/developer-reported evidence. Mail, refresh/revocation, lost-device and wider-device coverage remain open. |
| Existing tools and histories | Writing, Habit Record, prospective Protocol terms, Log correction/history, read-only Week/chapter/reading history delivered for bounded scopes. Six-tool local visual/interaction evidence is recorded; lived/device acceptance is separate. |
| Writing cloud foundation | Original and resolution migrations applied; bounded hosted two-account and separate-test-store reload checks recorded. Product activation remains off. |
| General safe sync and operations | Other domains, production writing-store/device recovery, personal migration, backup/restore, deletion and protected admin operations remain incomplete. |
| Onboarding/Home | Replacement onboarding planned. Personal Imprint selected as Home direction; exact visual/data model and compatibility remain open. |
| Membership/live Athena | Planned; no provider, live generation or server-enforced paid service is certified. |
| Beta readiness/release | Not certified or authorized. Historical Phase 1 is not certified either. |

Use [architecture](PRODUCTION_ARCHITECTURE.md), the
[sync contract](ACCOUNT_WRITING_SYNC.md), [bugs](../bugs.md) and
[journey evidence](USER_JOURNEY_TESTING.md) for bounded claims.
Applied non-idempotent migrations must not be reapplied.

## Dependency sequence

| Stage | Required outcome | Exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Contracts and critical journeys | Agree each bounded slice; resolve data-safety, cross-account or blocked-path defects before affected work | Reproduction or qualified non-reproduction, intended behavior, focused checks and isolated mobile runtime evidence |
| 2. Records and safe sync | Reviewable histories, durable owner-scoped local/remote writes, exact acknowledgements, chosen conflicts, clearing/deletion and recovery | Production adapters, offline/retry/lost response, two-account denial, device restart, account changes, stale devices and backup/restore checks |
| 3. Replacement onboarding | Implement the planned flow after records/history and safe-sync prerequisites; preserve old access, versions and runs | Public signup/verification recovery, branching, interruption/offline resume, one habit creation, actual previews, birthday/feeling ownership, no duplicate outcome or AI request |
| 4. Membership/admin | Manual grants/revocation/expiry, audit, usage reservations and spending controls | Server-enforced entitlement, fixed-day renewal, concurrency, failed-request release, free core/old readings after expiry |
| 5. Requested Athena | Authorized same-owner evidence, requested reading/reply, sourced observations and reviewed correction controls | Grounded multilingual synthetic cases, exclusion/correction propagation, safe failures, no generation on save, observed cost/latency |
| 6. Beta readiness | Working target journeys, installation/update, privacy/recovery and operations in the chosen environment | Actual phone/browser/region evidence, deletion/restore, feedback/support/rollback, named accepted limits |
| 7. Authorized release and observation | Developer-authorized deployment; observe first days and later weeks | Verification in the deployed tester environment, understandable tester outcomes and reverified fixes |

Onboarding stays after records/history and safe sync and before readiness.
Its scheduling relative to membership/Athena can be reviewed without removing
those dependencies. A finished Personal Imprint formula or the deferred Reflect
redesign is not silently added as a release gate. Required Home destination
behavior must be reviewed with onboarding; do not invent placeholder content.

## Release gates

- No unresolved data-loss, cross-user disclosure or core-path blocker.
- Representative phone browsers verify setup, returning use, chapter resume,
  completion/corrections, reload, offline behavior and installation/update.
- One profile per account; owner checks also cover server/background paths.
  Offline-entry proof never grants remote write authorization.
- Migrations preserve representative histories and have backup/rollback.
  Personal legacy import has explicit ownership and approval.
- Manual deletion, backup expiration within 30 days, restore suppression,
  retained-local isolation, protected admin writing access and admin-only logs
  have evidence. No beta user export/download is required.
- Essential histories preserve wording, dates, immutable chapters/readings and
  deliberate corrections. Completed Week reviews stay read only; past Habit
  corrections and the shared day view are deferred.
- Free/expired users retain core tools, history, sync and received readings.
  Paid generation has verified ownership, allowance and failure accounting.
- Published data-use/provider facts, lost-email recovery, support/feedback,
  rollback and accepted operating limits are understandable.
- Agree supported devices/browsers, regional checks, duration and success
  criteria before readiness. The old 4–6 week estimate is retired.
- Local builds and synthetic checks do not stand in for hosted/device acceptance.
  Release always needs explicit authorization.

## Later work

Use beta evidence to choose broad performance/refactor work, search, further
chapter simplification and optional gamification. Define fairness, privacy and
scoring before any leaderboard. Content Admin now follows the Admin-first priority above.
Native continuation requires separate framework, storage/session, accessibility,
lifecycle and release-migration decisions.

Next work is selected from [WORK_PLAN.md](WORK_PLAN.md), not from the retired
numbered-phase history in the [archive](archive/2026-11-11-doc-cleanup/ROADMAP.md).
