# Circle Design Guide

Updated: 2026-11-11, Asia/Bangkok. This owns the visual contract.
[Product](docs/PRODUCT.md) owns meaning; the
[Page standard](app/os/APP_SESSION_STANDARD.md) owns interaction and motion.
Earlier trials are [historical](docs/archive/2026-11-11-doc-cleanup/DESIGN.md).

## Identity

**Whole. Human. Alive.** Circle is a calm place to notice life, choose actions
and reflect. It must not pressure someone through a score of their worth.

Use the exact palette and typefaces in [brand-system.ts](app/brand-system.ts).

| Token | Value | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bone | #F1EFE8 | Reading and primary wording |
| Ink | #191813 | Foundation and focused depth |
| Orange | #E36B37 | Action, identity and active state |
| Charcoal | #403E35 | Structure and secondary information |

Geist owns every functional app surface. Cormorant Garamond is only for outer
editorial headings. Use simple English. Do not shrink type to force a fit.

Solid Light/Orange/Dark themes remain available in existing compact/chapter
contexts. The six opened tools use the approved dark glass family below.
Glass reflections may derive from brand colors; decoration never implies data,
progress or new evidence. Do not apply generic editorial motion to app controls.

## Shared tool contract - 2026-11-11

Applies to Note, Deep Thoughts, Routine, Protocol, Log and Week, including
History, Trash, Record, phases, details, corrections, confirmations and writing
sync. Routine is the reference. Update this contract when a shared rule changes;
do not prepend another conflicting feature override.

| Role | Size / weight | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heading | 28px / 700 | 1.2 leading, -0.015em tracking |
| Primary wording and action labels | 18px / 700 | Compact task leading 1.3 |
| Prose | 18px / 400 | 1.5 leading |
| Header navigation | 16px / 700 | 1.4 leading, sentence case |
| Supporting wording, time/location, cues | 16px / 400 | Week steps are supporting wording under bold goals |
| Metadata and dates | 12px / 400 | Preserve readability |

Only weights 400/700. Reading, editing and placeholders use matching role
metrics. Text entry remains borderless, including focus, with a visible caret.
Non-text controls keep visible keyboard focus.

### Spacing and geometry

- Use shared four-pixel spacing tokens. Standard padding is 24px, measured
  from the inside frame border to visible wording/glyph/rim edges.
- Header-to-first-Heading/Body, Main-to-Sub and Body-to-Footer are 24px.
  There is no 48px forehead exception in these six tools or supporting views.
- Main begins at that anchor and grows downward; changing line count never
  recentres it. Empty optional regions occupy no space.
- Section/action-to-cue gap is 40px; cue wording-to-arrow gap is 4px.
  App-to-App gap remains 16px where applicable.
- Reference Routine rhythm: 4px within Habit fields, 8px between rows, 12px
  list-to-creation-action and 40px between Habits and Tasks.
- Cross glyphs begin at the 24px left anchor; Routine copy retains its 20px
  indent. Visible completion rims meet the 24px right anchor. Invisible targets
  may enter gutters but must not overlap adjacent targets.
- Week columns: goal cross/Add goal plus at 24px; goal words/Add goal label
  and task cross/Add step plus at 44px; task words/Add step label at 64px.
  Goal-group gap is 24px, task/add gaps 8px and goal-to-task gap 12px.
- One focused minimum is measured against bottom navigation and safe areas.
  Short pages share it; real content grows downward with natural page scrolling.
  The retired 480px/60dvh writing/history cap does not apply to opened tools.
  Preserve frame width, top edge, radius and material during Page changes.

### Frame and controls

The App Box owns border, background, shadow, clipping, radius and height change.
Pages move inside it without another outer card. Reference frame radius is 36px,
with quiet pale reflection, Bone rim, faint Orange depth and 24px backdrop blur,
saturation 1.2. Controls have brighter silver reflections, 8px blur, Ink lower
edges and faint Orange shadows. Verify vendor prefixes in compiled production CSS.

| Control | Current visual rule |
| --- | --- |
| Glass action | Shared 52px height, 12px radius, 18px/700 label, full width between 24px anchors |
| Completion face | 28px Orange glass rim, 2px Ink gap, 22px Orange liquid |
| Checkmark | Immediate white Geist ✓, 16px/400, matching Log's save mark |
| Clear | 8px cross, 1.5px strokes, at least 44px target |
| Every interactive control | At least 44px effective target and meaningful accessible name |

Liquid rises over the shared 300ms completion response. Protocol word taps do
nothing: only its checkbox toggles. Kept words remain visible and fill Orange
with the same upward liquid clip, curve and 300ms duration, without strikethrough.

Use the shared glass variables under .circle-os in app/os/os-app.css, including
panel/action dimensions and blur. Keep the button engine and shared control
components; Button Studio experiments are not defaults.

### Motion and verification

The [shared interaction table](app/os/APP_SESSION_STANDARD.md#shared-tool-interaction-contract---2026-11-11)
owns timing. Week no longer waits for a checkbox-first sequence or a three-second
goal dwell. Evidence saves immediately; text responds over 300ms. Structural
resize is 600ms; typing is immediate. Header reflection is 240ms inside letters;
glass press/release is 150/400ms.

Reduced motion uses direct endpoints, reduced transparency removes glass/artwork,
and forced colors preserve readable/announced states. Decoration never delays
an action. Existing Page travel stays quick; staged arrival belongs only to a
genuinely new cover.

Run the tool-consistency browser matrix and affected journeys using compiled
production CSS. Measure visible edges, role typography, all Note/Deep Thoughts/
Habit/Protocol reference frames, forehead gaps, long growth and intermediate
motion. Token assertions alone do not establish visual consistency. Include
focus/targets, preferences and relevant persistence with synthetic isolated data.
Record actual results in the [journey record](docs/USER_JOURNEY_TESTING.md).

## Shared Page anatomy

Header, Heading, Main Body, Sub Body and Footer are the shared regions.
Main/Sub carry roughly two-to-one visual weight, not reserved blank space on
Cover or writing pages. Content-heavy Routine/Protocol tracks size to real rows.
The frame stays still and paints one uninterrupted shape while Pages move.

Compact/chapter contexts retain their shared default minimum and existing
tokens unless explicitly adopted into the opened-tool contract. Do not copy the
six-tool dimensions into Reflect, chapters or Admin as an unreviewed redesign.
The [Page standard](app/os/APP_SESSION_STANDARD.md) distinguishes those contexts.

- **Cover:** one hook, optional subtitle, no Header label, never editable;
  Swipe to begin / Swipe to see cue.
- **Chapter:** progress at right only, one question/lesson and one interaction;
  Continue/Confirm action. Short inputs do not manufacture extra height.
  Existing editable short/long question and declaration contexts retain their
  approved 29px main / 18px body scale until separately changed.
- **Note:** full-page free writing, Back/History and New Note. Line is hidden.
- **Deep Thoughts:** Quote/History, question/answer and Send or Save changes;
  Next question is deliberate.
- **Reading:** distinct authored prose and source evidence; no invented missing
  words or borrowing current observations into an old edition.

## Navigation and materials

The persistent bottom navigation covers Home, Today, Reflect and Explore,
including opened tools; current /os entry remains Today. It may hide for the
keyboard under the existing behavior. Home/Explore remain intentionally empty.

Reuse PageLayout, SwipeSession, useAppBack, RoutineHeaderButton, RoutineSwipeCue
and the button engine. Their legacy names do not restrict reuse to one tool.
Manual pairs remain Note/Deep Thoughts, Routine/Protocol and Log/Week. Deep
Thoughts' Note cue and Week's Log cue begin at the left anchor.

The full-page thread background is decorative, shell-bounded and sharp. Honor
reduced-transparency/motion preferences. Do not repurpose it as Home evidence.

## Future design boundaries

[Personal Imprint](docs/PERSONAL_IMPRINT_HOME.md) is the selected Home direction;
its silhouette and source/brightness/fade formulas remain open.
[Onboarding](docs/ONBOARDING_SPEC.md) is the replacement target, not implemented.
The [Reflect proposal](docs/REFLECT_PAGE_POTENTIAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md) is saved
for later; no new discovery-writing or declaration layout is adopted here.

The developer decides visual language. Installed Taste skills can improve craft
but cannot override Circle identity, this guide or the Page standard.
Admin previews use the production frame/anatomy and bounded parent width;
choice options remain one full-width row each. Preview metadata does not call AI.
